## Description
Boostogy pronounced Boost-o-g is designed to enhance the schoology experience through UI and minor feature changes. Some features are temporary as a result of broken schoology features such as custom sorting and hiding classes. This product is in no way competing with schoology or has any association with the company schoology. Some may be concerned about the permission to view every page you visit; however, the framework used called cross-rider depends on this permission and in no way is this extension recording personal data.
